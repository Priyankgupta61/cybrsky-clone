          Pentesting is one of the critical aspects of cybersecurity that
          enables organizations to know and respond appropriately to attacks.
          However, it is a very resource-intensive task. It goes without saying
          that pentesting can only be done in short bursts and demands
          significant resources from both the attackers as well as the
          defenders.
